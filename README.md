# Speaker tips

This is what we paste in an email to speakers:

Sorry for the form letter style of this but... here are some notes and tips that we've found help make a successful event:

* We ask speakers to keep the talk to about 30-40 minutes, with 20 minutes for Q&A.  Our attendees enjoy the dialog.
* Our attendees are very technical. Don't hold back the technical info. No sales pitches.
* The most successful presentations have at least one rehearsal in front of a live audience to give feedback.  We recommend doing the talk for coworkers prior to the event.  Alternatively we have volunteers that would gladly do a rehearsal with you over video chat; they give excellent feedback.  
* In the unlikely event that a problem arises and you might not be able to make the presentation, please let us know as early as possible.

I'm super excited about the talk and look forward to seeing you in MONTH!
